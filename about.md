# Welcome to my website!

Who or what is [Grey Crayon](https://greycrayon.com)? That's an excellent question, but unfortunately I do not have an excellent answer.

I am Grey Crayon. It's just a name that my son referred to me as. There is a wonderful book called [The Day The Crayons Quit](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/307942/the-day-the-crayons-quit-by-drew-daywalt-illustrated-by-oliver-jeffers/9780399255373/) by Drew Dewalt, where a young boys crayons send him complaint letters because he uses them in a narrow sort of way. During that time, because my work clothes were grey, my hair was going grey, and I felt pretty dull, then as a family we jokingly referred to me as Grey Crayon. The name stuck, and registered the domain.

Trying to think of names for my various projects are one of the big reasons that I never reach the end of a project. But I want to write about something now, so I'm using this name, as a means to an end.

I want to write a little bit about some of the stuff that interests me, and this is where I'm going to do it.

So, welcome, and I hope you find some of this stuff interesting in the same way that I do.

Yours,

Mr G Crayon
