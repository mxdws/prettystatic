### *[Pretty Static](https://prettystatic.com) is a blog about making websites.*

I know that sounds pretty general, so to add a bit more detail, I have been interested in Static Site Generators since I discovered Jekyll back in the year 2013. Since then, the world of web development has gone static-crazy, and I thought it might be the right time to chip in with my experiences.

The reason it is *Pretty* Static is because I am not entirely single minded in my advocacy for a website built from static HTML pages. For context, I am not a web developer, or indeed any kind of developer, and I want to learn all kinds of things. I believe that whilst static sites make things conveneient, it is good to get your hands dirty in the more complex stuff, and I will be looking to explore some of the not-so-static in this blog. Static can be the final leg of an extremely dynamic journey.

## Good people

Here is a list of the people that I have followed over the years and who have provided me with education, encouragement, perspective, wisdom, humour and most importantly in the digital world, humanity. If anyone is reading this and is interested in web development, follow these people if you aren't doing so already.

* **[Chris Coyier](https://chriscoyier.net)** - the man behind [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com) and [Codepen](https://codepen.io), with a wonderfully balanced, pragmatic and reasoned view of the world
* **[Travis Neilson](https://travisneilson.com)** - original creator of the Youtube Channel, [DevTips](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyIe-61Y8C4_o-zZCtO4ETQ). I would not know so much of what I know now if I'd never stumbled upon his channel, and found this gentle man with so much empathy
* **[Mattias Petter Johansson (aka MPJ)](https://twitter.com/mpjme)** - creator of Youtube channel [Fun Fun Function](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCO1cgjhGzsSYb1rsB4bFe4Q/feed) - quite possibly the only person in the world who I want to hear talking about Javascript
* **[Phil Hawksworth](https://hawksworx.com)** - advocate of the JAMstack, very funny, interesting to listen to, elegant problem solver
* **Peter Dawson** - or as I called him, Dad, who sat me down as a child to talk through the code he'd written on his massive computer



Enjoy!
