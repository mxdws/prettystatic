        <p>Autumn is possibly my favourite season. The colours. The cosiness. The shortening of days, and the lowering of the sun. So much to like. But this post does not have anything to do with the season.</p>

<p>In the last couple of years, I've started listening to lots of podcasts. One of these is a pretty popular podcast called <a href="https://gimletmedia.com/shows/reply-all">Reply All</a>. This podcast is all about the internet, which sounds like an unhelpful description, given the general nature of that term. But, it is my best description of it, and one of the episodes I loved was one simply called <a href="https://gimletmedia.com/shows/reply-all/o2ho2j/129-autumn">Autumn</a>.</p>

<p>I think one of the reasons I loved this episode was because I wasn't expecting it, and certainly wasn't emotionally prepared for it. I always had the impression that this podcast, whilst interesting, was just an undercurrent of a few guys goofing around trying to uncover terrible things that happen on the net, or weird phenomenon. And this story is certainly something that could only really happen in the age of the internet, but it's also so grounded in what it means to be human and have relationships.</p>

<p>Take a listen, if you've got 45 minutes to spare. </p>
